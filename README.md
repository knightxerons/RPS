This is  an AI `Rock Paper Scissors` game made with python. 

This game is designed in three parts :

1.) Gathering the dataset and training the model : The dataset used here was downloaded from kaggle and had three classes (Rock, Paper, Scissors).
                                                    The model was trained on that dataset with a val accuracy of 99.2%

2.) Creating a Haar Cascade classifier for detecting hand : The naive approach of making predictions on based of a specific ROI was unappealing, so I created a haar                                                              cascade classifier for a hand with 3 gestures upto 10th generation.

3.) Using Markov Chains to make the computer Intelligent : I used Markov chains to make the computer moves intelligent which porvides upto 0.7 winning porbability                                                              which is pretty impressive!!
